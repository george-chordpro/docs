## ChordPro

In ChordPro files, lyrics are interspersed with chords between brackets [ and ]. Strictly speaking it doesnâ€™t matter what you put between the [], it is put on top of the syllable whatever it is. But there are situations where it does matter: for chord diagrams and transpositions.

In general, ChordPro will try to interpret what is between the brackets as a valid chord name, unless the first character is an asterisk, *. In that case ChordPro will remove the asterisk and treat everything else as a text that will be printed just like the chord names. This can be used to add small annotations, e.g. [*Coda] and [*Rit.].
